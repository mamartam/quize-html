# 🧩Quiz game 
Interactive HTML Quiz built with Vanilla JavaScript, CSS animations and JSON data. Users can answer questions and see their final score.

##📦 Technologies
- HTML
  - Semantic HTML structure (section, article, main)
  - Data attributes (data-id) for linking questions and answers
  - Organized layout for welcome screen, quiz screen, and result screen

- CSS
  - CSS Variables (:root) for consistent color theming
  - Flexbox and Grid for responsive layout
  - CSS Animations and Keyframes for transitions and button effects
  - Media queries for tablet and desktop responsiveness
  - Hover and active states for interactive elements

- JavaScript
  - Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
  - DOM manipulation (querySelector, classList, dataset)
  - Event handling (addEventListener)
  - Fetch API for loading questions from external JSON file
  - Quiz logic (checking answers, navigating between questions, calculating score)
  - Dynamic UI updates (showing/hiding sections, animations, progress indicators)'

- JSON (data.json)
  - External data storage for quiz questions and answers
  - Structured question objects with: id, question, answers, correct index
  - Easy scalability for adding more questions

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to structure a small web application using semantic HTML and separate sections for different states (welcome screen, quiz screen, and result screen).
- Working with external data using the Fetch API and JSON files.
- Handling user interactions with event listeners and updating the UI dynamically.
- Using data-* attributes to connect DOM elements with application logic.
- Implementing quiz logic (checking correct answers, tracking user progress, and calculating the final score).
- Creating CSS animations and transitions to improve user experience.
- Managing application state (current question index and user answers).
- Building a responsive layout using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
- Organizing code by separating structure (HTML), styles (CSS), logic (JavaScript), and data (JSON).

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved

- Add visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers (highlight selected option in green or red).
- Implement a timer for each question.
- Add a restart button to allow users to retake the quiz.
- Save user results using localStorage to track progress over time.
- Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation and ARIA labels).
- Add smooth page transitions between quiz states (welcome, quiz, and result screens).
- Add sound effects or micro-interactions for better user engagement.
